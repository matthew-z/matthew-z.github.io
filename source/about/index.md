I am a postgraduate student of computer science in Tokyo, and my research interests are in the areas of machine learning, computational linguistics and information retrieval. I obtained a B.E in Electronics from Liverpool. Currently I am a member of [the Real Sakai Lab](http://sakailab.com), Waseda University. I would like to share my ideas and thoughts in my blog.

**Available for hire**. Check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhaohaozeng/en) profile or [CV](/about/Zhaohao_Zeng_cv.pdf) for more details please.
