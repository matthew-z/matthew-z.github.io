Artificial Intelligence(AI) is a pretty new topic in science and engineering, but one of its sub-topics called Machine Learning are much more popular than AI recently. People prefer talking about some fields, e.g. machine learning and computer vision rather than AI since AI sound like a fictional word after realised that a strong AI like "Jarvis" will not appear in a short time (say 20 years).
